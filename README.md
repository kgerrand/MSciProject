This repository is being used along side Weights and Biases to track different runs as I attempt to optimise this algorithm.
The algorithm in question is being developed as part of my MSci project in Atmospheric Computational Chemistry. The aim is to use machine learning to accurately predict baseline data points in a greenhouse gas concentration time series.
